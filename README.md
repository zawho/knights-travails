June 5, 2024 - I am now beginning the Knight's Travails project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I must create a function that finds the shortest path a knight can take on a chess board between any two given spaces. In so doing, I will need to utilize what I have learned about data structures and search algorithms.

August 19, 2024 - I have finished the Knight's Travails project. This project's reputation for difficulty on TOP's Discord server turned out to be well earned! Figuring out how to create the graph of all possible moves was fairly easy for me- but then applying BFS to find the shortest paths took me a good while to figure out. But I got there in the end and I'm happy with how it turned out.
