June 5, 2024 - I am now beginning the Knight's Travails project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I must create a function that finds the shortest path a knight can take on a chess board between any two given spaces. In so doing, I will need to utilize what I have learned about data structures and search algorithms.
